## VSCode Config
This is just a simple config for Visual Studio Code that I use for JavaScript projects, ocasionally written in TypeScript.

### How to use
Simply create `.vscode` directory in the root of your project and add:
* `extensions.json` - this will recommend you to install VSCode extensions under `Extensions`.
* `settings.json` - this will apply the rules of formating your code and some VSCode behaviour.
